Inverse word puzzle

Inverse Word Search - Recursively searches all the possible solution in the grid.

Given the dimensions (width and height) of a word search puzzle, a set of words that should appear in the grid (forwards, backwards, up, down, or along any diagonal), and optionally a set of words that should not appear anywhere in the grid will be detected by puzzle. Puzzle will find all the solution that can be valid, in a reasonable amount of time.
